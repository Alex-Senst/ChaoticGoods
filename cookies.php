                    </li>
                    <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your device when you visit a website. These files store information that helps improve your browsing experience by remembering preferences, recognizing returning 
                        visitors, and enhancing security. Cookies can be categorized into different types, including session cookies, which expire when you close your browser, and persistent cookies, which remain on your device for a 
                        longer period. Some cookies are essential for the Website’s functionality, while others are used for performance analysis and targeted advertising. Apart from cookies, other tracking technologies like web beacons 
                        and pixel tags may also be used to monitor Website interactions. While cookies do not typically contain personally identifiable information, they can be linked to such data when provided. It is important to understand 
                        the types of cookies used and their purposes to make informed choices about your browsing preferences. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but users can modify their settings to reject or delete them. However, 
                        disabling cookies may affect certain Website features and functionality.</p><br>

                        <b>How We Use Cookies</b>
                    </li>
                    <p>We use cookies for several purposes, including improving Website performance, personalizing content, enhancing security, and analyzing traffic patterns. Essential cookies are necessary for the proper functioning of the Website 
                        and enable core features such as navigation, security authentication, and accessibility. Performance cookies collect anonymous data on user interactions to help us optimize the Website. Functional cookies store user preferences, 
                        such as language and region settings, to provide a customized experience. Advertising cookies track browsing behavior to display relevant ads based on user interests. Analytics tools like Google Analytics may also be used to measure 
                        traffic and user engagement. By using cookies, we aim to enhance user experience and provide relevant content. Users can manage their cookie preferences through browser settings or opt-out mechanisms provided by third-party services. 
                        While cookies improve usability, we respect user privacy and strive to ensure compliance with applicable data protection regulations. If you wish to disable certain cookies, please refer to the instructions provided in the next section.

                        <b>Managing Your Cookies</b>
                    </li>
                    <p>You have the right to control how cookies are used on your device. Most web browsers allow you to manage cookie settings, including accepting, rejecting, or deleting cookies. You can usually find these options in the browser’s settings menu 
                        under "Privacy" or "Cookies." If you choose to disable cookies, certain Website features may not function correctly, affecting your overall experience. Additionally, third-party tools and browser extensions can help manage tracking technologies 
                        across different websites. Many advertising networks provide opt-out options to prevent targeted ads based on browsing behavior. To enhance privacy, users can enable browser settings that block third-party cookies or activate "Do Not Track" signals. 
                        However, blocking cookies may not entirely prevent data collection, as some technologies operate without them. It is advisable to regularly clear cookies to remove stored data that may affect browsing speed and security. If you need assistance with 
                        managing cookies, refer to your browser’s help section or visit online privacy resource websites for guidance. </p><br>
